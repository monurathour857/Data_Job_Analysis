Challenges with the Database:

●	Data Inconsistencies and Missing Information:
○	The database is filled with inconsistencies and missing values, making it difficult to rely on data.
○	Many critical details are embedded within lengthy, unstructured paragraphs, which makes data extraction a complicated task.

●	Fragmented and Disconnected Data Tables:
○	The dataset consists of multiple tables that are poorly structured, distorted, and fragmented.
○	There is a lack of connections and relationships between these tables, resulting in isolated data silos with no clear way to integrate the information.

●	Challenges Due to the Size of the Data:
○	The database is extremely large(7 lakh+ rows), presenting additional difficulties in managing and processing the data efficiently.
○	This requires careful planning to ensure that the Power BI report can handle the data volume without compromising speed or performance.

●	Power BI Report Optimization:
○	Special attention must be given to ensure that the final report in Power BI is fully optimised, 
○ allowing it to handle the data effectively while still providing accurate and comprehensive insights.

PROBLEM STATEMENT - 

1.	The company is facing challenges in understanding hiring trends over the years, which impacts strategic workforce planning.
Without a clear visual representation of job openings, it's difficult to identify peak hiring periods and adjust recruitment strategies accordingly.

This insight will enable more strategic recruitment planning and better alignment with market demands, ultimately enhancing the company’s hiring effectiveness.

3.	The company needs to identify which job types have the highest number of openings for each country and year. 
Understanding the dominant job types in various regions over time is crucial for tailoring recruitment strategies and addressing local market demands.
This analysis will provide valuable insights into global hiring trends, allowing the company to focus its efforts on the most sought-after positions in specific countries and improve its overall talent acquisition approach.

4.	The company aims to determine the average number of companies hiring over time to gauge overall market activity and stability.
